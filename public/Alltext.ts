This passion led me to pursue and earn both a bachelor's and master's degree in hydraulic and water resource engineering from Bahir Dar University. During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to teach and mentor numerous undergraduate students and even had my research published in international journals and conferences.",
  p2: "Despite my accomplishments in engineering, I couldn't shake off my childhood interest in the IT industry. So, I decided to take a leap of faith and attend two bootcamps to pursue a career as a full-stack software developer. Now, as a junior software engineer at McKinsey & Company, I continue to broaden my skills and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology. These diverse experiences have given me a unique perspective and approach to problem-solving, and I look forward to making more impactful contributions in the future.",
