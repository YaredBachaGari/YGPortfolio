## üí° Philosophy
Our experience tells us that skills are universal but oppurtunities are influenced by circumstancial enviorments. Our goal is to connect aspiring learners to the best instructors in their respective fields. Onwards!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Because of time constraints, we have not completed all modules. However, the first module indicates the direction project will continue by us or any developers who seeks to build on our foundation. 

Additionally, UI can be modified to be more personalized and presentable. Our main focus was on understanding the backend architecture while also reinforcing some cocepts on the front-end.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
